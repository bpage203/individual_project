IndividualProjectsSetF

This submission has serious problems. I went to every office hour session I could
from 12/3 until 12/9. I was rarely able to get help but the first solution I got
somehow caused my computer to be incompatible with Docker. Since then I have tried
to get one-on-one help but have not received any responses. I have tried for hours
to get Docker working again to no avail. For this reason I was not able to test
any of my code. I know this means that I am unable to receive a good grade on this
project. All I ask is that you glance at my code so that you can see I exhibited
understanding of all the concepts of this class. Though I could not debug my code
so I cannot guarantee it runs, I spend many hours looking through it and I believe
that with minimal debugging I would have been able to submit a fully working project.
Thank you for your consideration and have a great break. -Max
